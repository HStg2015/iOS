# iOS
The iOS-Part of the Hackathon Stuttgart 2015 App "donaid". For more information about the backend and the Android (which lets yoou print out the information for people without mobile devices already) app, please refer to their repositories ([backend](https://github.com/HStg2015/backend) & [Android](https://github.com/HStg2015/Android))

###Installation
Open **bitspls.xcworkspace** (Cocoapods recommended) via Xcode

###What's the problem?
"donaid" (from donate + aid) solves one pretty actual social problem: The distribution of donations to refugees and refugee camps. While right now many people want to help others fleeing from the Syrian civil war by donating clothes, furniture or similar goods or want to spend their time helping those people, many don't know how to help. Also on the other side, many social workers, for example in refugee camps, have to deal with way to much stuff they do in those camps, so they can't take a look at donations or people who could help them. "donaid" is the perfect solution for this problem.

###How does donaid solve the problem?
Good question. donaid consits of two main parts: The view for people searching for donations and the one for donators. Donators type in relevant information consisting of title, description, a category and an image of their donation, together with contact information including phone number, email address and ZIP code. Now, refugees or social workers in refugee camps can access those informations and contact the donators directly via their phone number or their email address. The corresponding [Android app](https://github.com/HStg2015/Android) already lets you print out that information to, for example, pin it on a pinboard so people searching for stuff but not having access to the internet can find donations for their needs.
