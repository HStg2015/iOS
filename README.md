# iOS
The iOS-Part of the Hackathon Stuttgart 2015 App "donaid". For more information about the backend and the Android app, please refer to their repositories ([backend](https://github.com/HStg2015/backend) & [Android](https://github.com/HStg2015/Android))

###Installation
Open **bitspls.xcworkspace** (Cocoapods recommended) via Xcode

###What's the problem?
"donaid" (from donate + aid) solves one pretty actual social problem: The distribution of donations to refugees and refugee camps. While right now many people want to help others fleeing from the Syrian civil war by donating clothes, furniture or similar goods or want to spend their time helping those people, many don't know how to help. Also on the other side, many social workers, for example in refugee camps, have to deal with way to much stuff they do in those camps, so they can't take a look at donations or people who could help them. "donaid" is the perfect solution for this problem.
