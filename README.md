# iOS
This is the iOS portion of the Hackathon Stuttgart 2015 App "donaid" (from donate + aid). For more information about the backend and the Android app (which lets you print out the information for people without internet access or a smartphone; iOS is about to follow) app, please refer to their repositories ([backend](https://github.com/HStg2015/backend) & [Android](https://github.com/HStg2015/Android))

###Installation
Open **bitspls.xcworkspace** (Cocoapods recommended) via Xcode

###What's the problem?
donaid helps with the distribution of donations to Syrian refugees and Syrian refugee camps. Today many people try to help refugees fleeing from the Syrian civil war by donating clothes, furniture, blankets, other supplies, or their time, and yet often these things aren’t exactly what’s needed. Equally, many social workers in refugee camps are so preoccupied with the immediate needs of refugees that they have no time to sort the donations they’ve received, let alone identify and match specific needs with donors. donaid attempts to solve this problem.

###How does donaid help?
donaid helps donors see what’s needed and social works see what’s been donated. Donors submit information about their donation, such as a photo, description, and category, as well as their contact information. Social workers can quickly review donation details, and contact donors directly if needed. Additionally, the [Android app](https://github.com/HStg2015/Android) can print out donation and donor information so it can be made available to people without internet access, perhaps via a public bulletin board in a refugee camp.
